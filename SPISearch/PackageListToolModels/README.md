# Explanation

I did a bunch of work, which apparently is for naught with macOS 12 and Xcode 14.3.1 to use PackageListTool
from the Swift Package Index repo directly, rather than copying these damned files into place.
I want to purge this and go BACK to using the API directly, rather than hacking and maintaining my own
variant, cause this kind of sucks.
