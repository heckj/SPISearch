Changes:
- repaired the navigation on iOS and iPadOS
- switched out SearchResult importer for reconstruction from Loki JSON export
- sample data (LOKI export) from Dev in Feb24:
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heckj/SPISearch/main/SPISearchTests/loki_export.json
can be downloaded and imported
- summary detail of searchresults and scoring is text only

Feedback desired:

- Do any further JSON exports from the dev environment cause issues or fail to
  import? (importer does logging with OSLog)

Upcoming:
- revising UI to make a unified "evaluate all the available search results"
  work on macOS (already does on iOS)
- adding graphical summary details with swift charts
- updating the search result review UI to be slightly more consistent -pinning
  percentage of view or something
- fixing up/adding reporting exporting from UI and CLI so that you can just
  get a quick "how's it doing" score value from one or more saved
  SerachResult documents.
